            <h4>SAS - Process Orchestration Intern</h4>
        <br>
            <p>As a Project Orchestration Intern, I worked with company executives to implement
            a company-wide code coverage system aimed at presenting code coverage data in a 
            easily digestible way while still retaining it's effectiveness. Making sure that 
            anyone from project managers to R&D executives could utilize the data presented. 
            This project was launched company wide, solidifying our succes in our resume.
            In the end me and my partner gained valuable experience in dealing with project 
            orchestration, code coverage, and leadership. Ultimately landing us both Year-Round Offers.</p>

            <h4>Raleigh SYEP - Web Design</h4>
        <br>
            <p>The SYEP (Summer Youth Employment Program) aimed at offering oppurtunities for teens in tech and business to 
                work with actual companies in their community developing websites or tackling other problems that said companies had. 
                Participating in this program was instrumental to developing proper problem solving skills early. At the end of the program
                 my team led our company to 86% more online traffic through their website.
