          <h4>SAS - Process Orchestration Intern</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            As a Project Orchestration Intern, I worked with company executives
            to implement a company-wide code coverage system aimed at presenting
            code coverage data in a easily digestible way while still retaining
            it's effectiveness. Making sure that anyone from project managers to
            R&D executives could utilize the data presented. This project was
            launched company wide, solidifying our success in our resume. In the
            end me and my partner gained valuable experience in dealing with
            project orchestration, code coverage, and leadership. Ultimately
            landing us both Year-Round Offers.

          <h4>Raleigh SYEP - Web Design</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            The SYEP (Summer Youth Employment Program) aimed at offering
            opportunities for teens in tech and business to work with actual
            companies in their community developing websites or tackling other
            problems that said companies had. Participating in this program was
            instrumental to developing proper problem solving skills early. At
            the end of the program my team led our company to 86% more online
            traffic through their website.

          <h4>Needham B. Broughton High School - Digital Design</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            For the duration of my junior and senior year of highschool I
            designed numerous posters, assets, and emblems for various
            highschool events. It required me to not only design assets that
            drew attention to these school events but also, representing the
            school correctly in branding, slangs, etc. Doing digital design
            challenged me to make decisions not based on what I want but in a
            way that represented the branding of our school.

          <p>
            Mid 2024, I started my own photography business in North Carolina,
            being a business owner is an invaluable experience requiring skills
            in communication, sales, outreach, networking, etc. One of the main
            challenges starting out required me to learn and develop my business
            and business model from scratch. That whole process required a whole
            realm of knowledge I previously did not have. The learning skills
            I've sharpened over time and my dedication to the project were the
            main contributions to my success. Without these skills I would've
            never earned over two-thousand dollars in revenue during my first
            quarter as a business.
