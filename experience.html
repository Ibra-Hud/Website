        <h4>SAS - Process Orchestration Intern</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          During my tenure as a Project Orchestration Intern, I collaborated
          closely with company executives to design and implement a
          comprehensive code coverage system across the organization. Our goal
          was to present code coverage data in a way that was both easily
          digestible and highly effective, ensuring usability for stakeholders
          at all levels, from project managers to R&D executives. The successful
          company-wide launch of this initiative underscored our proficiency and
          provided invaluable experience in project orchestration, code
          coverage, and leadership. As a result, both my partner and I were
          offered Year-Round positions, further solidifying the success of our
          efforts and the value of our contributions.

        <h4>Digital Design - Broughton High School</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          For the duration of my junior and senior year of highschool I designed
          numerous posters, assets, and emblems for various highschool events.
          It required me to not only design assets that drew attention to these
          school events but also, representing the school correctly in branding,
          slangs, etc. Doing digital design challenged me to make decisions not
          based on what I want but in a way that represented the branding of our
          school.

        <h4>Raleigh SYEP - Web Design</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          The SYEP (Summer Youth Employment Program) aimed at offering
          opportunities for teens in tech and business to work with actual
          companies in their community developing websites or tackling other
          problems that said companies had. Participating in this program was
          instrumental to developing proper problem solving skills early. At the
          end of the program my team led our company to 86% more online traffic
          through their website.

        <h4>North Carolina A&T</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          After High School I was granted a Full-Ride scholarship to attend
          North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in their
          Computer Science Program. There I completed my freshman year gaining
          skills in Python and developing large scale python projects which led
          to me earning various interviews with companies like Cisco and SAS,
          Ultimately choosing to intern with SAS over the summer. Afterwards I
          started my gap year and moved to New York to further my skills as a
          Software Engineer as well as establish my business.

        <h4>Marcy Lab School</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Upon relocating to New York, I joined The Marcy Lab School, a
          distinguished alternative to traditional college education, which
          equips individuals with the essential skills to become full stack
          developers. Marcy fellows are recognized for their exceptional
          development capabilities, leadership qualities, and, most importantly,
          their aptitude for learning. Given the accelerated nature of Marcy’s
          program, designed to prepare us for the workforce within a year, it
          demands an extraordinary level of dedication and an almost obsessive
          commitment to our development and educational progress in order to
          thrive and succeed.

        <h4>Starting</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Creating Apiary was a long-held aspiration of mine, driven by a desire
          to own a venture that truly represents my identity and values. I
          envisioned a company capable of positively impacting the lives of
          those around me. With limited resources but abundant ambition, I
          embarked on establishing my photography business, aiming to shape a
          life I have always dreamt of. Every moment is spent working towards a
          vision that is wholly mine, steadfastly pursuing my dream without
